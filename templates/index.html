				<h3>Team History</h3>
				<p>The Eleanor Roosevelt High School Robotics Club was founded in 1998 for the original intent of expanding the science and technology oriented enrichment programs at our school. Since the pilot year of this program, we have branched out from the original focus of our club and have begun to contribute more to the general community. From encouraging students to participate in the prestigious FIRST Robotics Competition to launching science and technology enrichment programs at local elementary schools, our team has a proven history of inspiring students to pursue STEM careers and engaging in the community.</p>
