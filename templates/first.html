		<h2>Principles of FIRST</h2>
		<article class="entry">
			<h3>Gracious Professionalism&#174;</h3>
			<p>Dr. Woodie Flowers, FIRST National Advisor and Pappalardo Professor Emeritus of 
				 Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, coined the term "Gracious Professionalism®."
				 Gracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things 
				 that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community.
				 With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate 
				 notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another 
				 with respect and kindness in the process. They avoid treating anyone like losers. 
				 No chest thumping tough talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, 
				 competition, and empathy are comfortably blended.  In the long run, Gracious Professionalism 
				 is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction 
				 of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity.</p>

			<h3>Coopertition&#174;</h3>
			<p>Coopertition® produces innovation. At FIRST, Coopertition is displaying unqualified 
			kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. Coopertition is founded on 
			the concept and a philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate with each 
			other even as they compete.  Coopertition involves learning from teammates. It is teaching 
			teammates. It is learning from Mentors. And it is managing and being managed. Coopertition 
			means competing always, but assisting and enabling others when you can.</p>
